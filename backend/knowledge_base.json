Start small - even €500 can prevent going into debt. Keep it in a separate savings account, not mixed with spending money. In Finland, consider high-interest savings accounts from banks like Nordea or OP that still allow quick withdrawals. Young adults should aim for at least €1000-2000 as a starter fund."

Over 30 years, that €1000 becomes €7612 without adding anything! Starting early is crucial - investing at 20 vs 30 can double your retirement savings. Index funds provide average 7-10% annual returns historically. Albert Einstein called compound interest 'the eighth wonder of the world'."

      "content": "Passive income = money earned without active work. Sources: dividends from stocks (3-4% yield), rental property income (after costs, 3-5% yield), index fund growth (7-10% long-term), online business (e-books, courses, affiliate marketing), royalties (music, books, patents), peer-to-peer lending (risky, 5-8%). Start with index funds - most accessible. €100,000 invested → €7,000/year passive income (7% return). Build over time. By 30s, aim for €500-1000/month passive income. By 40s, €2000-3000/month. Eventually covers all expenses = financial independence."
