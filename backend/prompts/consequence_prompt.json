  "instruction": "Generate a consequence narrative AND the actual effects of the player's action.\n\nConsider:\n1. Risk level of the action (high risk = more variable outcomes, can go very well or very badly)\n2. Player's current situation and resources\n3. Realistic outcomes (high risk actions should sometimes fail badly)\n4. Both intended and unintended consequences\n5. Market realities (meme stocks are volatile, index funds are stable, etc.)\n\nFor the narrative:\n- Write 2-3 sentences explaining what happened\n- Be realistic based on the risk level\n- Use \"you\" and make it personal\n- Show the actual outcome clearly\n\nFor the effects:\n- Determine realistic financial changes based on what happened\n- Include life metric changes (energy, motivation, social, knowledge)\n- Make effects proportional to the amounts involved\n- Consider both immediate and ongoing impacts",
  
  "template": "Player Context:\n- Name: {player_name}, Age: {current_age}\n- City: {city}, Education: {education}, Risk Attitude: {risk_attitude}\n\nBEFORE Action:\n- Cash: €{money_before:.0f}\n- Monthly Income: €{monthly_income:.0f}\n- Monthly Expenses: €{monthly_expenses:.0f}\n- Investments: €{investments_before:.0f}\n- Passive Income: €{passive_income:.0f}/month\n- Debts: €{debts:.0f}\n- FI Score: {fi_score_before:.1f}%\n\nLife Metrics BEFORE:\n- Energy: {energy_before}/100\n- Motivation: {motivation_before}/100\n- Social Life: {social_before}/100\n- Financial Knowledge: {knowledge_before}/100\n\nAction Chosen: {chosen_option}\nRisk Level: {risk_level}\nCategory: {category}\n\nEvent Context:\n{event_narrative}",
  
  "format_instruction": "Respond with a JSON object:\n{\n  \"narrative\": \"2-3 sentence story of what actually happened\",\n  \"effects\": {\n    \"money_change\": float (negative for spending, positive for gains),\n    \"investment_change\": float (negative if investment lost value),\n    \"debt_change\": float (positive increases debt, negative reduces it),\n    \"income_change\": float (monthly income adjustment),\n    \"expense_change\": float (monthly expense adjustment),\n    \"passive_income_change\": float (monthly passive income adjustment),\n    \"energy_change\": int (-50 to +50),\n    \"motivation_change\": int (-50 to +50),\n    \"social_change\": int (-50 to +50),\n    \"knowledge_change\": int (0 to +30, always gain some knowledge)\n  }\n}\n\nExample for HIGH RISK action that FAILED:\n{\n  \"narrative\": \"You invested €500 in that meme stock, riding the hype wave. Unfortunately, the stock crashed within days as the hype faded, and you lost €350 of your investment. The remaining €150 is barely worth holding. It's a painful but valuable lesson in speculative investing.\",\n  \"effects\": {\n    \"money_change\": 150,\n    \"investment_change\": -500,\n    \"debt_change\": 0,\n    \"income_change\": 0,\n    \"expense_change\": 0,\n    \"passive_income_change\": 0,\n    \"energy_change\": -10,\n    \"motivation_change\": -20,\n    \"social_change\": -5,\n    \"knowledge_change\": 15\n  }\n}\n\nExample for LOW RISK action:\n{\n  \"narrative\": \"You opened a diversified index fund account and invested €500. The fund is performing steadily with the market, and you're earning modest but reliable returns. You feel good about this smart, low-risk choice and are learning about long-term investing.\",\n  \"effects\": {\n    \"money_change\": -500,\n    \"investment_change\": 500,\n    \"debt_change\": 0,\n    \"income_change\": 0,\n    \"expense_change\": 0,\n    \"passive_income_change\": 2.5,\n    \"energy_change\": 0,\n    \"motivation_change\": 10,\n    \"social_change\": 0,\n    \"knowledge_change\": 10\n  }\n}\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- HIGH RISK actions should have variable outcomes (sometimes big wins, often losses)\n- LOW RISK actions should have predictable, modest outcomes  \n- Money changes must be realistic (if they invested €500, changes relate to that amount)\n- Knowledge_change should usually be positive (learning from experience)\n- Be honest about failures - high risk means real possibility of loss"
