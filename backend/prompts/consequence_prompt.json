  "instruction": "Generate a consequence narrative AND the actual effects of the player's action.\n\nConsider:\n1. Risk level of the action (high risk = more variable outcomes, can go very well or very badly)\n2. Player's current situation and resources\n3. Realistic outcomes (high risk actions should sometimes fail badly)\n4. Both intended and unintended consequences\n5. Market realities (meme stocks are volatile, index funds are stable, etc.)\n\nFor the narrative:\n- Write 2-3 sentences explaining what happened\n- Be realistic based on the risk level\n- Use \"you\" and make it personal\n- Show the actual outcome clearly\n\nFor the effects:\n- Determine realistic financial changes based on what happened\n- Include life metric changes (energy, motivation, social, knowledge)\n- Make effects proportional to the amounts involved\n- Consider both immediate and ongoing impacts",

The hype peaked quickly, but then reality hit and the stock crashed hard.

The fund has been performing steadily with the market, showing modest but reliable returns. You feel good about this smart, low-risk choice.\",\n  \"outcome\": {\n    \"action_type\": \"investment\",\n    \"investment_details\": {\n      \"principal\": 500,\n      \"asset_type\": \"index_fund\",\n      \"result_quality\": \"gain\"\n    },\n    \"life_metrics\": {\n      \"energy_change\": 0,\n      \"motivation_change\": 10,\n      \"social_change\": 0,\n      \"knowledge_change\": 10\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nExample 3 - MEDIUM RISK investment with SLIGHT LOSS:\n{\n  \"narrative\": \"You invested €700 in a tech ETF.

You're saving €65 per month, but you feel less motivated without the gym routine and miss your favorite shows for relaxing after work.\",\n  \"outcome\": {\n    \"action_type\": \"expense\",\n    \"expense_changes\": {\n      \"expense_subscriptions_change\": -65\n    },\n    \"life_metrics\": {\n      \"energy_change\": -10,\n      \"motivation_change\": -15,\n      \"social_change\": 0,\n      \"knowledge_change\": 5\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nExample 5 - LIFESTYLE change (reduce food budget):\n{\n  \"narrative\": \"You decided to cut your food budget by €100/month by meal prepping and avoiding restaurants. You're eating simpler meals and cooking at home more. While you're saving money, you miss the variety and convenience of eating out, and you feel slightly less energetic from the plainer diet.\",\n  \"outcome\": {\n    \"action_type\": \"expense\",\n    \"expense_changes\": {\n      \"expense_food_change\": -100\n    },\n    \"life_metrics\": {\n      \"energy_change\": -8,\n      \"motivation_change\": -5,\n      \"social_change\": -8,\n      \"knowledge_change\": 8\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nIMPORTANT - You provide QUALITATIVE outcomes, the financial calculator handles NUMERIC calculations:\n- For investments: specify the principal amount, asset_type, and result_quality (major_gain/gain/neutral/minor_loss/loss/major_loss)\n- For expenses: specify the exact monthly expense changes by category\n- For income/debt: specify the exact change amounts\n- The financial calculator will compute actual money_change, investment_change, and passive_income_change based on your qualitative assessment\n\nRESULT QUALITY Guidelines:\n- major_gain: 20-35% gain (rare, lucky timing)\n- gain: 5-15% gain (solid positive outcome)\n- neutral: -2% to +2% (no significant change)\n- minor_loss: 5-10% loss (small setback)\n- loss: 15-30% loss (significant but recoverable)\n- major_loss: 40-70% loss (major failure)\n\nREMEMBER:\n- HIGH RISK actions have variable outcomes (major_gain to major_loss possible)\n- LOW RISK actions have predictable outcomes (neutral to gain usually)\n- Only specify principal (amount invested) and qualitative outcome - calculator handles the math\n- Knowledge_change should usually be positive (learning from experience)\n- Use expense categories for lifestyle changes\n- Lifestyle changes have trade-offs: saving money often costs energy, motivation, or social life"
