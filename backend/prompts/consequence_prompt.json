Risk level of the action (high risk = more variable outcomes, can go very well or very badly)\n2. Player's current situation and resources\n3. Realistic outcomes (high risk actions should sometimes fail badly)\n4. Both intended and unintended consequences\n5. Market realities (meme stocks are volatile, index funds are stable, etc.)\n\nFor the narrative:\n- Write 2-3 sentences explaining what happened\n- Be realistic based on the risk level\n- Use \"you\" and make it personal\n- Show the actual outcome clearly\n\nFor the effects:\n- Determine realistic financial changes based on what happened\n- Include life metric changes (energy, motivation, social, knowledge)\n- Make effects proportional to the amounts involved\n- Consider both immediate and ongoing impacts",

The hype peaked quickly, but then reality hit and the stock crashed by 70%. Your €500 investment is now worth only €150. A painful but valuable lesson in speculative investing.\",\n  \"effects\": {\n    \"money_change\": -500,\n    \"investment_change\": 150,\n    \"debt_change\": 0,\n    \"income_change\": 0,\n    \"expense_change\": 0,\n    \"passive_income_change\": 0,\n    \"energy_change\": -10,\n    \"motivation_change\": -20,\n    \"social_change\": -5,\n    \"knowledge_change\": 15\n  }\n}\n\nExample 2 - LOW RISK investment that GAINED value:\n{\n  \"narrative\": \"You opened a diversified index fund account and invested €500. The fund has been performing steadily with the market, and it's now worth €510 after modest but reliable returns. You feel good about this smart, low-risk choice.\",\n  \"effects\": {\n    \"money_change\": -500,\n    \"investment_change\": 510,\n    \"debt_change\": 0,\n    \"income_change\": 0,\n    \"expense_change\": 0,\n    \"passive_income_change\": 2.5,\n    \"energy_change\": 0,\n    \"motivation_change\": 10,\n    \"social_change\": 0,\n    \"knowledge_change\": 10\n  }\n}\n\nExample 3 - MEDIUM RISK investment with SLIGHT LOSS:\n{\n  \"narrative\": \"You invested €700 in a tech ETF. The market fluctuated with some volatility, and your investment dropped slightly to €650 after a minor correction. It's a learning experience in market timing.\",\n  \"effects\": {\n    \"money_change\": -700,\n    \"investment_change\": 650,\n    \"debt_change\": 0,\n    \"income_change\": 0,\n    \"expense_change\": 0,\n    \"passive_income_change\": 0,\n    \"energy_change\": -5,\n    \"motivation_change\": -10,\n    \"social_change\": 0,\n    \"knowledge_change\": 20\n  }\n}\n\nExample 4 - LIFESTYLE change (cancel subscriptions):\n{\n  \"narrative\": \"You canceled your Netflix, Spotify Premium, and gym membership to save money. You're saving €65 per month, but you feel less motivated without the gym routine and miss your favorite shows for relaxing after work.\",\n  \"effects\": {\n    \"money_change\": 0,\n    \"investment_change\": 0,\n    \"debt_change\": 0,\n    \"income_change\": 0,\n    \"expense_change\": 0,\n    \"passive_income_change\": 0,\n    \"expense_subscriptions_change\": -65,\n    \"energy_change\": -10,\n    \"motivation_change\": -15,\n    \"social_change\": 0,\n    \"knowledge_change\": 5\n  }\n}\n\nExample 5 - LIFESTYLE change (reduce food budget):\n{\n  \"narrative\": \"You decided to cut your food budget by €100/month by meal prepping and avoiding restaurants. You're eating simpler meals and cooking at home more. While you're saving money, you miss the variety and convenience of eating out, and you feel slightly less energetic from the plainer diet.\",\n  \"effects\": {\n    \"money_change\": 0,\n    \"investment_change\": 0,\n    \"debt_change\": 0,\n    \"income_change\": 0,\n    \"expense_change\": 0,\n    \"passive_income_change\": 0,\n    \"expense_food_change\": -100,\n    \"energy_change\": -8,\n    \"motivation_change\": -5,\n    \"social_change\": -8,\n    \"knowledge_change\": 8\n  }\n}\n\nREMEMBER:\n- HIGH RISK actions have variable outcomes (big wins or big losses)\n- LOW RISK actions have predictable, modest outcomes\n- Always show the FULL transaction: cash out (-money_change) and investment value gained (+investment_change)\n- Knowledge_change should usually be positive (learning from experience)\n- Be realistic about market behavior and risk levels\n- Use expense categories for lifestyle changes - they show player where money goes\n- Lifestyle changes have trade-offs: saving money often costs energy, motivation, or social life"
