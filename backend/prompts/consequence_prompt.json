  "instruction": "Generate a consequence narrative AND the actual effects of the player's action.\n\nConsider:\n1. Risk level of the action (high risk = more variable outcomes, can go very well or very badly)\n2. Player's current situation and resources\n3. Realistic outcomes (high risk actions should sometimes fail badly)\n4. Both intended and unintended consequences\n5. Market realities (meme stocks are volatile, index funds are stable, etc.)\n\nFor the narrative:\n- Write 2-3 sentences explaining what happened\n- Be realistic based on the risk level\n- Use \"you\" and make it personal\n- Show the actual outcome clearly\n\nFor the effects:\n- Provide QUALITATIVE outcomes (MCP server calculates actual numbers)\n- Include life metric changes (energy, motivation, social, knowledge)\n- Consider both immediate and ongoing impacts",
