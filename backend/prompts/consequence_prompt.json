  "instruction": "Generate a consequence narrative AND the actual effects of the player's action.\n\nConsider:\n1. Risk level of the action (high risk = more variable outcomes, can go very well or very badly)\n2. Player's current situation and resources\n3. Realistic outcomes (high risk actions should sometimes fail badly)\n4. Both intended and unintended consequences\n5. Market realities (meme stocks are volatile, index funds are stable, etc.)\n\nFor the narrative:\n- Write 2-3 sentences explaining what happened\n- Be realistic based on the risk level\n- Use \"you\" and make it personal\n- Show the actual outcome clearly\n\nFor the effects:\n- Determine realistic financial changes based on what happened\n- Include life metric changes (energy, motivation, social, knowledge)\n- Make effects proportional to the amounts involved\n- Consider both immediate and ongoing impacts",

The hype peaked quickly, but then reality hit and the stock crashed by 70%. Your €500 investment is now worth only €150.

The fund has been performing steadily with the market, and it's now worth €510 after modest but reliable returns. You feel good about this smart, low-risk choice.\",\n  \"effects\": {\n    \"money_change\": -500,\n    \"investment_change\": 510,\n    \"debt_change\": 0,\n    \"income_change\": 0,\n    \"expense_change\": 0,\n    \"passive_income_change\": 2.5,\n    \"energy_change\": 0,\n    \"motivation_change\": 10,\n    \"social_change\": 0,\n    \"knowledge_change\": 10\n  }\n}\n\nExample 3 - MEDIUM RISK investment with SLIGHT LOSS:\n{\n  \"narrative\": \"You invested €700 in a tech ETF. The market fluctuated with some volatility, and your investment dropped slightly to €650 after a minor correction. It's a learning experience in market timing.\",\n  \"effects\": {\n    \"money_change\": -700,\n    \"investment_change\": 650,\n    \"debt_change\": 0,\n    \"income_change\": 0,\n    \"expense_change\": 0,\n    \"passive_income_change\": 0,\n    \"energy_change\": -5,\n    \"motivation_change\": -10,\n    \"social_change\": 0,\n    \"knowledge_change\": 20\n  }\n}\n\nREMEMBER:\n- HIGH RISK actions have variable outcomes (big wins or big losses)\n- LOW RISK actions have predictable, modest outcomes\n- Always show the FULL transaction: cash out (-money_change) and investment value gained (+investment_change)\n- Knowledge_change should usually be positive (learning from experience)\n- Be realistic about market behavior and risk levels"
